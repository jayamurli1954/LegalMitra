As LegalMitra, your specialized AI Junior Lawyer for the Indian legal system, I have thoroughly reviewed the provided legal notice and the web search results for "8061/2018". Below is a comprehensive summary of the document, an exhaustive analysis of your legal options as of 2025, and details regarding the case citation.

### 1. Summary of the Legal Notice

**Parties:**
*   **Client (Notice Sender):** Mr. Mohd Abuzar, a concerned citizen of India and social activist associated with NGO ANHAD.
*   **Noticee (Recipient):** Facebook India Online Services Private Limited.

**Date of Notice:** 19.10.2020

**Core Grievance:**
The legal notice, issued on behalf of Mr. Mohd Abuzar, alleges that Facebook India Online Services Private Limited (referred to as 'the Noticee' and 'the said platform'):
1.  **Arbitrary Account Memorialization:** On 13th September 2020, Facebook memorialized Mr. Abuzar's user account (`facebook.com/abuzar.choudhary`), publicly announcing his supposed death and prompting friends and relatives to "tribute" him and "share stories, commemorate a special day."
2.  **Failure to Rectify:** Despite Mr. Abuzar's immediate attempts to log in (which resulted in an 'Account unavailable' message) and his compliance with Facebook's instructions to upload a government ID via email, the account was not restored. Subsequent attempts and requests from his friends and relatives (including on Twitter) also failed to elicit a response or resolution.
3.  **Malafide Intent:** The Notice alleges that Facebook acted abruptly, whimsically, arbitrarily, and with malafide intent, without following any procedure to confirm the information or taking cognizance of Mr. Abuzar's requests. It suggests this action might be due to Mr. Abuzar being "vocal on the issues affecting and relating to the public."
4.  **Causing Trauma and Loss:** Facebook's actions are stated to have caused immense mental trauma, torture, and harassment to Mr. Abuzar and his network, and irreparable loss due to the termination of his account.

**Legal Grounds Cited in the Notice (as of 2020):**
*   Violation of fundamental rights under the Indian Constitution, specifically:
    *   **Article 19(1)(a):** Freedom of speech and expression (due to termination of the account and denial of platform for expression).
    *   **Article 14:** Equality before law (due to arbitrary action).
*   Commission of "series of cognizable offences under the Indian Penal Code, 1860."

**Demands Made in the Notice:**
The notice calls upon Facebook India to comply with the following demands within seven days:
a.  Tender an unconditional apology to Mr. Abuzar, in writing and by publishing it prominently on the Facebook platform and its official page.
b.  Revoke the termination and restore the Facebook account (`facebook.com/abuzar.choudhary`).
c.  Pay a compensation of Rs. 5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs only) for causing immense trauma and torture.

**Consequence of Non-Compliance:**
Initiation of "appropriate legal proceedings, both civil and criminal" against Facebook India.

### 2. Issue Identification

The primary legal questions arising from the document are:
1.  What are the available civil and criminal legal recourses for Mr. Mohd Abuzar against Facebook India for arbitrarily memorializing his account, spreading false information about his death, causing mental trauma and loss, and failing to provide a proper grievance redressal mechanism?
2.  What is the current legal position regarding the liability of social media intermediaries in India, especially considering the legal landscape in 2020 (when the notice was issued) and the significant reforms up to 2025?

### 3. Applicable Law (Comprehensive Analysis, including 2025/2024 Updates)

The legal notice was issued in October 2020. Any *subsequent* legal proceedings would be governed by the laws in force at the time of initiation, while the *cause of action* originated in 2020. Therefore, it's crucial to consider both the legal framework of 2020 and the current (2025) framework for effective legal strategy.

**A. Laws Relevant to the Cause of Action (Primarily 2020, but current for proceedings):**

1.  **The Constitution of India, 1950:**
    *   **Article 19(1)(a) (Freedom of Speech and Expression):** While primarily applicable against the State, the Supreme Court has in certain contexts recognized the enforceability of fundamental rights against private entities performing public functions or acting in an arbitrary manner, especially for online platforms that serve as significant public forums. The argument is that arbitrary deactivation curtails expression.
    *   **Article 14 (Equality before Law and Equal Protection of Laws):** This prohibits arbitrary action. The notice contends Facebook's actions were whimsical and arbitrary, thus violating this principle.

2.  **Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC):** (Relevant for the "cognizable offences" mentioned, though procedure now under BNSS)
    *   **Section 499 (Defamation):** Making or publishing any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person. Memorializing an account falsely implying death could be construed as defaming the person by publishing false information that harms their reputation (e.g., by causing distress, alarm, or suggesting absence/incapacity).
    *   **Section 500 (Punishment for Defamation):** Simple imprisonment for up to two years, or fine, or both.
    *   **Section 503 (Criminal Intimidation):** Threatening injury to a person's reputation. While less direct here, the notice implies Facebook's intent to cause mental agony.
    *   **Section 509 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman):** Not applicable here.
    *   *Note on Transition:* The **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023** has replaced the IPC. For offenses committed *before* the effective date of BNS, the IPC, 1860, would apply to the offense itself. However, any criminal proceedings initiated *after* the effective date of BNS will follow the procedures laid down in the **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023**, which replaced the CrPC.
        *   **BNS equivalent for Defamation:** BNS Chapter XXI, Section 356 and 357. The substance remains largely similar for defamation.

3.  **Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC):** Governs civil suits for damages, injunctions, etc.

4.  **The Indian Contract Act, 1872:**
    *   The terms of service of Facebook, which users agree to, form a contract. Breaching assurances about privacy, safety, and proper account management could constitute a breach of contract, entitling the user to damages. The notice explicitly refers to "public offers... and assurances about privacy and safety."

5.  **The Consumer Protection Act, 2019:**
    *   **Section 2(7):** Defines "consumer" to include any person who "hires or avails of any service for a consideration." While Facebook's basic services might be "free" in monetary terms, the user provides personal data, views advertisements, and contributes to the platform's value, which can be argued as "consideration."
    *   **Section 2(11):** Defines "defect" in relation to goods and "deficiency" in relation to services. Lack of proper grievance redressal, arbitrary account suspension, and failure to ensure safety and privacy as advertised would constitute "deficiency in service."
    *   **Section 2(47) (Unfair Trade Practice):** Making false representations about the goods or services, or providing false assurances.
    *   Consumers can file a complaint with the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (District Commission) for relief including compensation for any loss or injury suffered (including mental agony), and directions for restoration of service.

6.  **The Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act):**
    *   **Section 79 (Exemption from liability of intermediary in certain cases):** This section generally provides safe harbour to intermediaries if they observe due diligence. However, this safe harbour is conditional. If an intermediary fails to observe due diligence or if its actions are in violation of laws, it can lose its safe harbour protection.
    *   The **Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (IT Rules, 2021)**, which *replaced* the earlier 2011 Rules, were notified *after* this notice (on February 25, 2021). These rules significantly enhanced the due diligence requirements for intermediaries, including:
        *   **Grievance Redressal Mechanism:** Mandated appointment of a Grievance Officer, acknowledgment of complaints within 24 hours, and resolution within 15 days.
        *   **Specific provisions regarding user content removal and accountability.**
        *   *Update (2024-2025):* Further amendments to the IT Rules, 2021, and the broader legal landscape continue to refine intermediary liability, emphasizing transparency, user safety, and robust grievance redressal. The **Finance Act 2025** and **GST 2.0 reforms (2025)** are *not directly relevant* to this specific case concerning online platform liability for defamation/arbitrary action. However, the overarching push for digital accountability is a continuous theme.

7.  **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act):**
    *   **Effective Date:** This Act came into force in 2023. While not applicable to the original cause of action in 2020, it is the *current* and most relevant law for data protection and privacy in India.
    *   **Key Provisions:** It establishes duties of Data Fiduciaries (like Facebook) to protect personal data, notify Data Principals (users) about data breaches, and have a robust grievance redressal mechanism. Arbitrarily processing personal data (like implying death based on unverified information) or failing to protect user identity would attract penalties under this Act. If a similar incident were to occur today (2025), the DPDP Act would be a powerful recourse.
    *   **Penalties:** Significant monetary penalties for non-compliance.

**B. Not Applicable (for clarity):**
*   **GST 2.0 Reforms (2025) & Finance Act 2025 GST Amendments:** These pertain to Goods and Services Tax and are not directly relevant to the current query concerning intermediary liability, defamation, and consumer protection.

### 4. Case Law Analysis

For the specific reference "8061/2018" at the end of the legal notice, it appears to be an **Enrollment Number** for Advocate Chaus Abdul Aziz (MAH/8061/2018), issued by the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa. This is **not a case citation**.

However, the search results provided do show several cases with "8061/2018" as part of their **case number** in the Delhi High Court. It is critical to understand that these cases are **not** directly related to the advocate whose enrollment number is MAH/8061/2018, nor do they pertain to the subject matter of the legal notice regarding Facebook India and Mr. Mohd Abuzar. They are independent cases that happen to share a number sequence.

Based on the provided web search results, the most consistently identified case with "8061/2018" in its number is:

**Case Name:** **Layak Ram vs. Government of NCT of Delhi & Ors.**
*   **Citation (Case Number):** W.P.(C) 8061/2018
*   **Court:** High Court of Delhi
*   **Year:** 2018 onwards (appears in cause lists from 2018 to 2021 and possibly later)
*   **Key Principles / Nature of Case (from search snippets):** This appears to be a Writ Petition (Civil) filed by Layak Ram against the Government of NCT of Delhi and others. The snippets mention "LALIT KUMAR RAWAL (Advocate for Petitioner)", and "Other Case filed against same P.S.-FIR No. : (NANGLOI-148/1998)" suggesting it may involve matters related to police action, FIRs, or government functioning.
*   **Relevance to Query:** **Not directly relevant** to the legal notice regarding Facebook India or Mr. Mohd Abuzar. This case does not involve Facebook as a party nor does it deal with the issues of social media intermediary liability, defamation, or arbitrary account suspension.
*   **Current Status:** Appears to be an active case in the Delhi High Court over several years as seen in various cause lists. Its final disposition is not clear from the provided snippets.

Other snippets mentioning "I.A. 8061/2018" refer to Interim Applications within other civil suits (e.g., CS(OS) 2349/2015, CS(OS) 2339) in the Delhi High Court. These are also not directly related to the present legal notice's subject matter.

### 5. Legal Position Summary & Comprehensive Analysis

As of 2025, the legal position regarding social media intermediary liability and user rights is significantly more defined than in 2020.

*   **Intermediary Liability:** While Section 79 of the IT Act, 2000, offers safe harbour to intermediaries, this protection is conditional upon their adherence to due diligence requirements. The arbitrary action of memorializing an active user's account without verification, failing to restore it despite user compliance, and lacking a transparent grievance mechanism would likely be seen as a failure of due diligence, potentially removing safe harbour protection for Facebook.
*   **Defamation (Civil & Criminal):** Publishing false information implying Mr. Abuzar's death would prima facie constitute defamation. A civil suit for damages for loss of reputation and mental agony is a strong recourse. A criminal complaint under the BNS (erstwhile IPC) for defamation is also a possibility, though the threshold for criminal defamation is high (intent/knowledge to harm reputation).
*   **Consumer Protection:** Facebook, despite being a "free" service, can be considered to provide "services" for "consideration" (data, engagement, ad views). The arbitrary suspension and lack of redressal constitute a "deficiency in service" or "unfair trade practice" under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The Consumer Commissions offer a streamlined and cost-effective remedy for compensation and service restoration.
*   **Data Protection:** With the enactment of the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act)**, the processing of Mr. Abuzar's personal data (including his existence status) without his consent and in an arbitrary manner, leading to harm, would be a clear violation. The DPDP Act introduces significant penalties for such non-compliance and strengthens the individual's right to correction and erasure of their data. While the incident predates the DPDP Act's effective date, any continued non-compliance or failure to address the data-related aspects would be viewed through the lens of current data protection principles.
*   **Fundamental Rights:** The arguments based on Articles 14 and 19(1)(a) remain strong. While direct enforcement against a private entity is complex, the Supreme Court has indicated that constitutional values must permeate private relations. The arbitrary denial of a platform for expression, especially for a social activist, could be a compelling ground.
*   **IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 & subsequent amendments:** These rules, which were *not* in force when the notice was issued but are current law, now place a much higher burden on social media intermediaries to establish robust grievance redressal mechanisms. Failure to resolve complaints within stipulated timelines (15 days for general complaints, 24 hours for specific content categories) can lead to loss of safe harbour. If a similar incident happened today, these rules would provide specific procedural grounds for challenging Facebook's inaction.

### 6. Practical Advice and Legal Options

Given the summary of the legal notice and the legal landscape, here are the legal options available to Mr. Mohd Abuzar in 2025:

1.  **Civil Suit for Damages and Injunction:**
    *   **Grounds:** Defamation, breach of contract (of terms of service), tort of negligence, and causing mental agony/harassment.
    *   **Reliefs:**
        *   Declaration that Facebook's actions were illegal, arbitrary, and defamatory.
        *   Permanent injunction directing Facebook to restore the account and refrain from similar actions.
        *   Substantial monetary damages for defamation, mental trauma, loss of reputation, and business/social opportunities (the Rs. 5,00,000/- sought in the notice can be a starting point, but actual damages could be assessed higher based on evidence).
        *   Costs of litigation.
    *   **Forum:** Appropriate Civil Court (e.g., District Court).
    *   **Strengths:** Allows for detailed evidence presentation, comprehensive remedies, and higher compensation claims.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Can be time-consuming and expensive.

2.  **Consumer Complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019:**
    *   **Grounds:** Deficiency in service (arbitrary account suspension, failure to resolve issue, lack of proper grievance mechanism) and unfair trade practice.
    *   **Reliefs:**
        *   Direction to Facebook to restore the account.
        *   Compensation for mental agony, harassment, and any actual loss suffered.
        *   Punitive damages (if Facebook's conduct is egregious).
        *   Litigation costs.
    *   **Forum:** District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.
    *   **Strengths:** Relatively faster and less formal than a civil suit, cost-effective. Specifically designed for consumer grievances.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Monetary jurisdiction limits exist for District Commissions (up to Rs. 50 lakhs), State Commission (up to Rs. 2 crore), and National Commission (above Rs. 2 crore).

3.  **Criminal Complaint:**
    *   **Grounds:** Defamation under **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023** (erstwhile IPC Section 499/500).
    *   **Procedure:** A complaint can be filed before a Judicial Magistrate under Section 154 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023 (erstwhile CrPC).
    *   **Reliefs:** Conviction and punishment (imprisonment or fine) of the responsible individuals within Facebook India (directors/officers) and potentially the company itself.
    *   **Strengths:** Creates a strong deterrent effect, public condemnation.
    *   **Weaknesses:** High burden of proof (beyond reasonable doubt), proving *mens rea* (criminal intent) for defamation can be challenging. Criminal proceedings are primarily for punishment, not for specific relief like account restoration or large compensation.

4.  **Writ Petition (under Article 226 of the Constitution):**
    *   **Grounds:** Violation of fundamental rights (Articles 14 and 19(1)(a)) due to arbitrary action by a powerful private entity affecting public functions or public interest.
    *   **Forum:** High Court.
    *   **Strengths:** Direct intervention by a High Court; speedy justice possible for clear fundamental rights violations.
    *   **Weaknesses:** High threshold for enforceability of fundamental rights against a purely private entity; the High Court may direct the party to pursue alternative remedies (e.g., civil suit, consumer complaint) if the facts are highly disputed or involve complex contractual issues. However, if the issue is purely about the arbitrary action of a dominant public platform impacting free speech, it might be entertained.

5.  **Complaint to Regulatory Authorities (under IT Act / DPDP Act):**
    *   **Grounds:** Violation of the **IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021** (as amended) and the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023**.
    *   **Forum:** Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Grievance Redressal Officer of Facebook India, or the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) under the DPDP Act.
    *   **Reliefs:** Directions to Facebook to comply with rules, restore account, pay penalties under DPDP Act.
    *   **Strengths:** Focuses on regulatory compliance, relatively new and powerful tools under DPDP Act.
    *   **Weaknesses:** DPBI is still new, its exact functioning and speed of redressal are evolving.

**Recommendation on Strategy:**

Given the multi-faceted nature of the grievance, a two-pronged approach could be most effective:

*   **Option 1 (Primary): Consumer Complaint:** This offers a relatively quick, cost-effective, and direct route for obtaining account restoration and compensation for deficiency in service and unfair trade practices. The Consumer Commissions are well-equipped to handle such grievances against service providers.
*   **Option 2 (Secondary/Concurrent): Civil Suit:** For a more comprehensive claim for damages, particularly if the mental trauma and loss of reputation are substantial and require a detailed evidentiary process. It provides for a higher claim value and a deeper analysis of contractual breaches and tortious liability.

A criminal complaint should be considered carefully, as it's a graver step and difficult to prove intent, but can be effective in compelling action. A writ petition should be considered if all other remedies fail or if the arbitrary action is demonstrably a severe infringement of fundamental rights by a monopolistic digital platform.

### 7. Documentation Required

Regardless of the chosen legal option, the following documents would be crucial:
*   Copy of the Legal Notice sent to Facebook India.
*   Proof of dispatch/delivery of the Legal Notice (speed post receipt, email delivery confirmation).
*   Screenshots of the memorialized account, error messages, and public messages published by Facebook.
*   Screenshots/records of communication with Facebook (emails, help center interactions, tweets).
*   Government ID uploaded by Mr. Abuzar.
*   Evidence of impact (statements from friends/relatives regarding their grief, any evidence of loss of opportunities).
*   Mr. Abuzar's user agreement/terms of service with Facebook (if available).

This exhaustive analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the legal pathways available to your client, Mr. Mohd Abuzar, taking into account both the historical context and the current robust legal framework in India.
